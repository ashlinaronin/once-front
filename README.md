Just beginning development on this project. Much to do. Learning a lot about the MEAN stack.

start mongo and tell it to run in the background (&)
mongod &

sudo npm install
npm start


starting to think i don't really need to use gridfs for this
because the files will almost certainly all be less than 16mb
and i want to get them atomically, not in chunks...
