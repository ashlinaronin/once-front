    Once.upon is an eternal communal fable in the browser; a glocal commons construed
    solely around the yarn; an Elysium of disembodied narrators.
    Each visiting teller in turn records a one-sentence continuation.
    As it is spoken, the contribution is automatically transcribed,
    analyzed for melodic contour and added to the page.
    Visitors may scrub through the collaborative chronicle at any time
    to follow the meandering melody and hear the tale told by its many makers.
