    Once.upon is an eternal communal fable in the browser;
    an Elysium of incorporeal narrators; a glocal commons borne of the yarn.
    Each visiting teller in turn records hirself speaking a sentence.
    As it is spoken, the contribution is transcribed and saved, then the baton
    is passed to the next in queue. Visitors may listen back from any point.
